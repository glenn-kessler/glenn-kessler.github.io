                    <H1>hi there, it's a blog</H1>
                    <p>
                            In here goes anything I'm too lazy to categorize.
                        Some thoughts, some (probably bad) poetry, hopefully only a few rants, and other stuff I couldn't think of when I was writing this line.

            Unsurprisingly most are hiding after ending their carer.
            Without doing any math, in the US girls with asian heriatage on average are staying 4 years.
            One even stayed for a stunning 22 years.

        <p> 2018-11-26 Could it be that KI, AI, machine learning, and whatever solving problems using neuronal networks is or will be called, could it just be, that it's simply a lazy way of getting the same results if one would just sit down and use some old fashioned math? Just thinking. </p>
