Over the recent years my view shifted from technic enthusiast towards critc.
Here's an example to why I think critical of technology.
One ISP called Verizon has been throttling the bandwidth of an unlimited wireless internet connection rented by the Santa Clara Fire Department.
The Fire department had been using the internet to coordinate their operations.
Upon reaching a Limit of about 25MBps their badwidth was reduced to  0.5%, or less of that.
Of course the underlying problem is social, something which can't be solved by using technlogy.
And of course the united states are not the whole world.
I believe we should care much more about how we structure our society, about wheter or not we want everything to be seen through the view of maximized monetary income.
We raise our children to share, to be nice and kind, so they can later on enjoy their lives among other people without constantly running into unnecesary conflicts (though there are necessary confilcts that need to be gone through).
So why don't we do the same with our big companies?
Consequences are in need to correct undesirable behavior, such as limiting the bandwith of those who are supposed to safe our asses in times of crisis.
I do understand also, that service must be paid for.
So there must be a discussion on how to proceed.
