Over the recent years my view shifted from technic enthusiast towards critc.
The reason for that?
A mixture of greed, incompetence, stupidity.
One recent nudge towards the critic was the ISP Verizon throttling the bandwidth of an unlimited wireless internet connection
in service of the Santa Clara Fire Department.
The Fire departmen had been using the internet to coordinate their operations.
Upon reaching a Limit of about 25MBps their badwidth was reduced to  0.5%, or less of that.
Wether or not Verizon has suffered at all or enough from the consequences of their greedy behavior remains to be discussed.
There are other stories, all of which can be repatriated towards greed, incompetence and or stupidity.
