            As a junior programmer, co-workers are one very valuable source of insight.
            I might stumble upon those bits of iformation elsewhere,
            but that's not what this is about.

					2018-11-22 Malloc will reserve a piece of memory in heap are.
          Depending on your system this usually means 1 to 4 KByte, no matter how tiny your variable.
          If, for example, you're using malloc to reserve memory for a 2 Byte variable,
          it gets a whole kilo byte at the least to reside in.
          So, malloc is something you'd use for bigger data structures.
